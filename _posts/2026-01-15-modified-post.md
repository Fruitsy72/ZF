In the beginning of June 2025 I started my position as a Lead Meteorologist. Since I have joined the team I have been working on a handful of things. 
Making forecasts for our Facebook page for the state of Texas and for the North Central Texas region. 
Assisting developers and designers with our website to make it very functional for potential clients while presenting necessary meteorological information. 
Using python to be able to test our new API data from the Weather Company to see what is viable for our website.
